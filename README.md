# Snake for Nerds

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake game that runs entirely in an HTML5 window.

## How to Play

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Use the arrow keys to move the snake around the board. Eat the red food squares to grow longer. Avoid running into the walls or into the snake's own body. Each time you eat food your score increases and a short tone plays. If you crash, a lower tone sounds and the game ends. High scores are stored locally in your browser so you can compete against yourself.

## Files

- `index.html` – The main HTML page with a canvas element for rendering the game.
- `snake.js` – JavaScript logic that controls the game loop, input, and rendering.

No external libraries are required.
